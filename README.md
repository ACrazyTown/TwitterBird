# Kill The Twitter Bird
## Unstable Development Branch

This is the development branch for Kill The Twitter Bird (fairly unstable and not close to being finished).

**This branch will most likely get archived as soon as the most major issues get fixed.**

## Issues/Enhancements

* Hitboxes won't WORK!!!!
  * Don't know why, don't know who but Hitboxes on scaled FlxNapeSprites just refuse to work properly, this is literally one of the biggest bugs as of right now.

* Game becomes playable after transition finishes.
  * Transition to **PlayState** is actually disabled because of this. It's not THAT big of an issue but still.
