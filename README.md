# Kill The Twitter Bird
## Unstable Development Branch

This is the development branch for Kill The Twitter Bird (fairly unstable and not close to being finished).

**BASE GAME IS FINISHED AND BUGS HAVE BEEN FIXED. THIS BRANCH IS NOW ARCHIVED AND WILL NO LONGER BE USED**

_I am aware that the code is messy and shit but after all this is a development branch and I AM gonna clean it up after I get most of the main crap working_

**This branch will most likely get archived as soon as the most major issues get fixed.**

## Issues/Enhancements

* game unplayable until the transition is finished
  * Transition to **PlayState** is actually disabled because of this. It's not THAT big of an issue but still.
